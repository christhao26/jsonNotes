<h1>Updating Resources! </h1>


<body>
    A resource can be updated by sending a PATCH request to the URL that represents the resource. <br>

    The URL for a resource can be obtained in the self- link of the resource object. Alternatively, when 
    a GET request returns a single resource object as primary data, the same request URL can be used for
    updates. <br>

    The patch request MUST include a single resource obeject as primary data. The resource object MUST 
    contain type and id members. 


    <h3>Updating a Resources's Attributes</h3>
    <div>
        Any or all of a resource's attributes MAY be included in the resource objects included in a PATCH
        request. <br>

        If a request does not include all of the attributes for a resource, the server MUST inerpret the missing attributesas if they were included with their current values. The sever MUST NOT interpret missing attributesas null values. <br>

        For example, the follwoing PATCH request is interpreted as a request to update only the title and text attributes of an article.<br>
<!-- show the code example from the webpage -->
    </div><br>

    <h3>Updating a Resource's Relationships</h3>
    <div>
        Any or all of a resource’s relationships MAY be included in the resource object included in a PATCH request.<br>

        If a request does not include all of the relationships for a resource, the server MUST interpret the missing relationships as if they were included with their current values. It MUST NOT interpret them as null or empty values.<br>

        If a relationship is provided in the relationships member of a resource object in a PATCH request, its value MUST be a relationship object with a data member. The relationship’s value will be replaced with the value specified in this member.<br>

        For instance, the following PATCH request will update the author relationship of an article<br>
    </div><br>
    <!-- show the code examples from the webpage -->
    
    <h3>Responses</h3>
    <div>
        202 Accepted
        If an update request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a 202 Accepted status code.<br>

        200 OK
        If a server accepts an update but also changes the resource(s) in ways other than those specified by the request (for example, updating the updated-at attribute or a computed sha), it MUST return a 200 OK response. The response document MUST include a representation of the updated resource(s) as if a GET request was made to the request URL.<br>

        A server MUST return a 200 OK status code if an update is successful, the client’s current fields remain up to date, and the server responds only with top-level meta data. In this case the server MUST NOT include a representation of the updated resource(s).

        204 No Content
        If an update is successful and the server doesn’t update any fields besides those provided, the server MUST return either a 200 OK status code and response document (as described above) or a 204 No Content status code with no response document.<br>

        403 Forbidden
        A server MUST return 403 Forbidden in response to an unsupported request to update a resource or relationship.<br>

        404 Not Found
        A server MUST return 404 Not Found when processing a request to modify a resource that does not exist.

        A server MUST return 404 Not Found when processing a request that references a related resource that does not exist.<br>

        409 Conflict
        A server MAY return 409 Conflict when processing a PATCH request to update a resource if that update would violate other server-enforced constraints (such as a uniqueness constraint on a property other than id).

        A server MUST return 409 Conflict when processing a PATCH request in which the resource object’s type and id do not match the server’s endpoint.<br>

        A server SHOULD include error details and provide enough information to recognize the source of the conflict.<br>

        Other Responses
        A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.<br>

        A server MAY include error details with error responses.<br>

        A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.<br>
    </div>
*************Path is for smaller updates <br>
Patch Example:
----------------
Consider a resource, employee. The JSON representation of an example might look like this:

{
 "name":"John Doe", "department":"sales", "salary":65500
}
If the salary field of this employee record needed updating, the PUT method could be used to replace the employee, but this would be wasteful.

The PATCH command could be used instead to send only the new salary:

{
"salary":70000
}
Then object look like this.
{
"name":"John Doe", "department":"sales", "salary":70000
}
<br> 

********put is for a larger update
